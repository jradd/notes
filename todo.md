# YaTodo
Yetâ€“another Todo


### Script  
Just a place to jot down ideas for tools/utils that may be worth fruition.  


- vimrc plugins
```
open vimrc
- parse plugins
** if valid is True:
** update()

check for alternatives ? 
# This would greatly complicate, but I noticed it would be really helpful, since for instance `gmarik/vundle` has
# recently changed to `VundleVim/Vundle`, which I think may have broken my vimrc.  

output diff changes
print revision or date in a comment
```





```
